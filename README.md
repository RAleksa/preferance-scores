It's a [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) for spreadsheets that keeps the scores of a card game named [Preferans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferans). Well, it's not really Preferans, it's a game my family has been playing for ages. I've been searching for it on the Web for a long time, and the closest thing I found was Preferans.
My family used to write down the scores on the piece of paper, until I coded this spreedsheet for us. We didn't have to calculate the scores manualy anymore!
